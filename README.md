# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project gives you a thorough look at theater and plays and the success of their campaigns though kickstarter. Though there are many other campaigns kickstarter offers these are the ones focused on in this project. This project will go into detail showing which theater and play campaigns are more successful based on goals and when the campaign is started.

### Purpose
The purpose of this  analysis is to give a more in depth look at the graphs provided and the challenge that was completed during the Excel module of the Data Analytics class. There were many challenges that were encountered and many things that were learned throughout this module. The main purpose of this analysis was to give Louise a better understanding of which kickstarter campaigns were successful and which failed. There are many different outcomes that will be presented in this analysis.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The outcomes based on Launch Date section provided lots of amazing informtion. one of the biggest outcomes that I noticed was that there is a peak in successful campaigns that launced in the middle of the year. (May through July) However there was also a higher failed rate in these same months which you can conclude that there were more projects started at this time in the year. There was also a very small portion of cancled theater campgains and about a 60% success rate for theater campaigns. Toward the end of the year there are also very few canceled campaigns which also helps show that most theater campaigns are started in the middle of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on this analysis the lower the goal target the higher chance of success there is for plays. As the Goals increase it seems that the success rate drops and the failure rate increases. However there are no canceled projects which means that most  of the campaigns actually succeeded. As you can see from the spreadsheet created, a large percentage of these campaigns succeeded. But like I said there is also an increased rate of success with lower goals and goals that are below 5000$

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were many things learned in this analysis. First and foremost how to use excel to chart and code to make the process easier. One of the challenges I personally encountered was with the COUNTIFS() command. I had issues for some reason when I originally linked it to the kickstarter worksheet data for goals where it showed no "goals" for the below 1000$ goal. I had to restart the code (even though I dont beleive i changed anything) for it to process the code and actually provide output. I then had issues with filling the rest of the spreadsheet for the outcomes based on goal segment of the challenge where it wouldnt paste and would link the clicked cell. However I overcame these challenges and finished the challenge. I also had a hard time figuring out how to provide the months in the pivot table for the launch dates section, which I eventually overcame.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions I can make from the outcomes based on Launch Date are, If you are going to launch a theater project launch is in May or June because they have the highest success rate. Also do not start a theater campaign at the end of the year because they have the lowest rate of success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude about outcomes based on Goals are, Set your expectations low and aim high. In otherwords dont set your goal too high, as it seems the higher the goal is the less successful the play projects are. Also that there are no cancelled projects for plays which is an extremely good sign for those who plan to start a play kickstarter campaign.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of this data set is that it is very specific to plays, which reduces your overall success and failed campaigns. If there was a comparitive dataset you could find out if its just plays or all kickstarter campaigns that are more successful at lower goal limits.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
some other possible tables and graphs we could create could be a stacked bar graph to show the fail and success of certain goal paramaters.
